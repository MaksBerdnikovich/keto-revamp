                            There are a few ways that you can track your ketone levels, depending mainly on your budget.
                            Urine ketone strips are the easiest to come by and they are relatively cheap, which enables
                            you to test more often. However, they only give you an estimation of the range of your
                            ketone levels. If you want to gain a bit more insights about how your body is handling your
                            ketogenic diet, you may want to check out our guide to measuring ketones on a ketogenic diet

                            The Keto Revamp meal plan can be adjusted if you begin losing weight faster than you feel
                            expected. When following the meal plan, most people can safely lose 2-4 pounds per week. If
                            you are losing weight faster than this, try the meal plan for 5 days and then go back to a
                            normal diet for 2 days - that's how simple it is. We recommend following the meal plan for
                            the first 60 days because seeing the fast results will motivate you to stick to the plan.
