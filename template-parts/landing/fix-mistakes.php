                    My new custom keto meal plan service takes the guesswork out of your diet and guarantees it will
                    work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been working closely with nutritionists, personal trainers, chefs, and fitness experts to
                    develop a personalized keto meal plan that is simple, convenient, affordable, and best of all -
                    delicious.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The term "personalized" meal plan means exactly that. Many nutrition "experts" charge way too much
                    money for meal plans that are nothing more than recipes pulled together from random blogs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To ensure optimal progress and a diet that you enjoy, we tailor your customized meal plan to your
                    unique lifestyle, age, needs, goals, and eating preferences (even for our vegetarian and vegan
                    friends).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can now say goodbye to restrictive diets that do no good and are ineffective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's time to choose a plan that’s specifically personalized to you.

                    Unless you've been living under a rock for the past few years, I'm sure you've heard of the keto
                    diet. You probably know someone who has completely changed their body with this diet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you forgot or just didn't know, here's a quick synopsis. A keto diet is a diet low in carbs,
                    moderate in protein, and high in fat. This means you'll eat tasty high-fat meals like steak tips
                    cooked in butter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Why is that important?” you make ask. When you consume very little carbs, your body enters a state
                    known as ketosis. You see, in the normal circumstances, glucose (the stored form of carbohydrates)
                    is the source of most of your energy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By reducing carbohydrate intake, however, you don't keep your body supplied with enough glucose to
                    fuel all its functions. To stay alive, the body needs to use an alternative energy source since some
                    tissues such as the brain cannot burn fat for fuel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ketones act as such a source. When your liver runs low on glucose, it produces ketones. Ketones can
                    be used as fuel for a variety of tissues such as the brain when glucose is unavailable. [28]
                    Otherwise, you would die.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you're in ketosis, your body is mainly fueled by ketones and fatty acids. That's important
                    because…

                                Need confirmation? The following are the results of a meta-analysis of thirteen
                                randomized controlled trials published in the British Journal of Nutrition: [29]
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                VLCKDs [very low carbohydrate ketogenic diets] achieve greater fat loss than LFDs [low
                                fat diets] in the long run, thus representing an alternative approach to losing fat.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The keto diet actually reduces belly fat and produces up to three times more weight loss
                                than a high-carb, low-fat diet, according to two randomized controlled trials! [30-31]
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Unbelievable, right!? Those following a keto diet lost more fat while eating tasty foods
                                such as bacon, ribeye, hot wings, and scrambled eggs. Yet why is it that the keto diet
                                is more fat-burning than normal diets?
