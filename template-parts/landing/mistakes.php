                            "Gurus" claim that losing weight and keeping it off comes down to controlling what you eat.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They say certain foods cause weight gain because they cause a hormonal environment that
                            stalls fat burning...however, other foods promote fat loss by balancing the system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is partially true, but it does not provide the complete picture. This is because in
                            order to reduce the number on the scale, you must enter a caloric deficit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's a simple process. Eating more calories than you burn leads to weight gain. Eating less
                            calories than you burn leads to weight loss. Science proves it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Do you want proof? Numerous studies demonstrate the importance of calorie balance. One of
                            them is a case study by Kansas State University professor Mark Haub.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Being aware of the importance of calorie balance, he decided to make an experiment. During
                            the two months he ate only junk food like Twinkies, Oreos, Doritos and protein shakes, while
                            maintaining a deficit of 800 calories a day.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Can you guess the result? He lost 27 pounds in just two months and reduced his body fat from
                            33.4% to 24.9%.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's not a diet I recommend, but it illustrates my point. You must be in a calorie deficit
                            if you want to lose fat.

                            If you get lean by cutting 350 calories per day, you'll get amazing results if you cut
                            1,200 calories per day right?

                            Physiologically, calorie deficits that are too severe wreck your body. This is why
                            almost all dieters who follow an extremely low-calorie diet regain the weight they
                            lost…sometimes they even gain a bit more.

                        <p>
                            The body isn't aware that you want to get fit for the beach. In reality, it thinks you
                            are stranded without food because your hungry.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Consequently, your metabolism will plummet, preventing weight loss. Therefore, your body
                            will begin storing food as fat as soon as you stop dieting because it thinks this will
                            all happen again.

                            This is why it’s crucial to keep your eating in line with a calorie target tailored to
                            your body, situation, and lifestyle.

                            We have examined calories so far. Although calories are a crucial component of fat loss,
                            they are by no means the only factor. What I’ve realized is people say they want to lose
                            weight, but in reality they want to look and feel healthier.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is important to not aim for weight loss if you want to achieve such feats. Instead, aim
                            for fat loss. It's because losing fat improves health and appearance more so than losing
                            weight.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In terms of fat loss, calories remain a crucial factor. However, your macronutrient intake
                            is equally important. Protein, carbohydrates, and fat are essential to your health. Your
                            macros set up will greatly influence what effect your food will have on your body.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In other words, if you keep a calorie deficit while eating excessive amounts of carbs, it
                            will be nearly impossible for you to lose fat. The reason is that carbohydrates spike
                            insulin, which curbs fat loss in two ways. Among the two, is that elevated insulin levels
                            block fat from being released from your fat cells. Without the ability to release fat from
                            your cells, your body cannot burn off the excess.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Next, as a result of elevated insulin levels, fat cells are formed as a result of the
                            storage of energy in your bloodstream. Rather than being burned by tissues like muscle, the
                            extra energy gets channeled to places like your hips and abs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because of insulin's role in fat storage, carb-rich diets make it difficult for the body to
                            burn off fat.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to insulin, there are many other examples. You need to optimize your macros for
                            many more reasons, and I will show you how to do it in a moment and quadruple fat loss.

                            A person's self discipline is like a battery - you only have a limited amount. It is because
                            very restrictive diets make you lose willpower, increase cravings, and lead to binging - the
                            worst outcomes when trying to build the body of your dreams. [26-27]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have seen it time and time again… a person who is dedicated to eating healthy and losing
                            weight. Initially, they restrict themselves to eating only tilapia, asparagus, and chicken.
                            They consider that to be a healthy diet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It may work for the first few weeks, and the dieter brings meal prepped boxes with "healthy"
                            meals wherever they go, but eventually their willpower runs out and the diet is abandoned.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Remember that dieting itself can be difficult. By enforcing unnecessary restrictions, you'll
                            only make things harder for yourself. As a result, you'll likely take on a "I quit" mindset
                            after a few weeks or even days, and wake up covered in candy wrappers, and be back at square
                            one.
